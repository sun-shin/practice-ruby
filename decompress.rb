#Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: roll which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and score which is called at the end and returns the total game score.

# would separate methods (roll, game score)
# to begin to solve roll method looking to take in numbers of pin knocked down during one turn (2 attempts) w/o spares and strikes
# would then implement spares and strikes and allow for 10 rounds

# class Bowling 

#   def initialize
    
#   end

#   def roll
    
#   end

#   def game_score
    
#   end
# end
